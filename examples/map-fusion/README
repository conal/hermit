Note: this example requires GHC >= 7.8 to run.

First install HERMIT, which can be done via Cabal:

> cabal install hermit

To run the example, invoke HERMIT as follows:

> hermit MapFusion.hs MapFusion.hec

If it runs successfully, you can use the HERMIT command "show-lemmas" to display the map-fusion lemma (which should be noted as proved).

hermit> show-lemmas
